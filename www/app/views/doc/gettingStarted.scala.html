  </div>
  <div class="panel-body">

    <p>In apidoc, a service represents a full REST service. Each
    service is fully described in a single file. By convention, we
    name these files 'api.json' and store them in the root of the
    project that defines the server implementing the service
    (e.g. the root directory of your source repository).</p>

    <p>
      The easiest way to get started is to download a sample api.json
      file and edit it. This <a href="@lib.Util.ApiDocExampleApiJsonUrl">api.json</a> file
      is the description of the REST API for apidoc itself.
    </p>

    <p>
      When you are ready, click &quot;@lib.Util.AddServiceText&quot;
      (located in the upper-right corner of your organization's screen) and
      upload your api.json file.
    </p>

    <p>
      View the <a href="@routes.DocController.apiJson">specification
      of api.json</a> to find detailed information on how to describe
      your service.

  <div class="panel-body">

    <p>You should now see documentation for your REST service. If you distribute the URL
    with the version number 'latest', you will always have a link to
    the most current version of your service.</p>

  <div class="panel-body">

    <p>When viewing your service, notice that the left-hand nav bar has a
    section titled "Clients". Take a look at the Ning Async Http Client
    1.8 and the Ruby client, for example, to see how they look.</p>

    <p>Each client is presented as a stand-alone single file, which
    should make it easy to drop directly into your project or to
    publish an artifact to a server for sharing.</p>

    <p>
      Start by describing your models, then map your models to
      resources that expose the specific operations you want to
      make available.
    </p>

    <p>
      api.json is designed to guide developers to think carefully
      about their APIs, while making it easy to create services that align
      to the REST standard. By favoring convention over configuration
      in a few key places, it enables developers to create great
      REST APIs. //I'd put this paragraph before the previous one

    <p>
      Download native client libraries with no (or almost no)
      dependencies. We take special care to make sure that client
      libraries are a pleasure to use.

    <p><b>Example from Ruby:</b></p>
    <pre>
      client = MyService::Client.new("http://localhost:8000")

      organizations = client.organizations.get(:limit => 10, :offset => 0)
      organizations.each do |org|
        puts "Org %s is named %s" % [org.id, org.name]
      end

      neworg = client.organizations.post(:name => "My org")
      puts "Created new org named %s" % neworg.name
    </pre>

    <p><b>Example from Scala:</b></p>
    <pre>
      val client = com.gilt.apidoc.Client.new("http://localhost:8000")

      val organizations = client.organizations.get(limit = Some(10), offset = Some(0))

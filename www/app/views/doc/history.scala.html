   apidoc is informed by the practical knowledge we've gained from scaling the Gilt
   technology organization across code, coding practices, people and teams. At the time we started 
   this project, the Gilt tech team included more than 100 active committers—each contributing 
   to a distributed micro-services architecture with +300 independent applications. This organization
   supports Gilt, a global online shopping destination that generates significant revenue and traffic.

   The idea for apidoc stems from our team's realization that, in order to continue iterating and growing, 
   we needed a new approach to handling the complexity of software development. We were about to reach 
   a new growth milepost, and needed to pivot.

   One of the core ideas that emerged from our discussions is "Schema-First" 
   development. If interface design is truly critical, then it is actually helpful 
   in practice to define your API by hand as a first-class artifact of software development. 
   With this principle in mind, we began exploring what was already available on the
   market—including handwriting interfaces for systems we were actively
   building. We looked at protobufs, Thrift, Avro, Swagger, Apiary
   and others before identifying our key requirements:

   <ul>

    <li> <em>JSON</em>. HTTP/JSON is everywhere. By focusing on this standard,
    we can ensure that all web developers--native application, web, 
    and back-end--can use the tooling we provide without facing any friction.</li>

    <li> <em>REST first</em>. api.json begins with a list of
    resources instead of operations. We want to encourage the
    identification of REST resources as early as possible in the
    development process.</li>

    <li> <em>Simple documentation</em>. With apidoc, all you have to do is upload a JSON file
    to generate first-class, simple and beautiful documentation. Using apidoc just for 
    documentation is one of our core intended use cases.</li>

    <li> <em>Simple and terse schema</em>. We wanted a web developer to be able
    to learn the schema just by looking at a few simple examples. Also,
  we are writing the JSON by hand and need it to be terse and
    clear.</li>

    <li> <em>No code annotations</em>. Too many annotations make
    it difficult to see the code. This is especially problematic if, like us, you're also working in a micro-services
    environment.</li>

    <li> <em>Compatibility with existing tools</em>. We borrowed everything we
    could from other projects and, where possible, adopted
    standards from existing work. We were heavily inspired by
    <a href="http://swagger.wordnik.com">Swagger</a> in particular.</li>

    <li> <em>Incredibly nice clients with no dependencies</em>. The developer
    experience using apidoc clients is amazing. We want developers to
    love apidoc clients so much, that they no longer want to write their own
    client libraries.</li>

   </ul>

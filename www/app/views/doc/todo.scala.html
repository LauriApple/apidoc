  <ul>

    <li> Implement backwards compatibility layer. Each new version of
         a service should be automatically validated against the
         latest version with the same major version number. Consider
         if we require semver versioning or not.
    </li>

    <li> Add email verification to join an organization by domain.
    </li>

    <li> Automate end to tests of generated clients. Currently client
         libraries are tested offline and manually. Need to think through
         how testing will work across mulitple platforms. // wasn't sure if it should be "end-to"
    </li>

    <li> api.json: Support authentication, documentation
    </li>

    <li> Swagger 2.0 was released in September 2014. Explore if
         Swagger 2.0 can become the input spec for apidoc.
   </li>

  </ul>

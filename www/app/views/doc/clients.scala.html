  <p>

    Code generation for high-quality client libraries to access
    services described in apidoc is one of our primary goals. apidoc
    supports client generation in multiple languages, and depending on community interest additional languages
    can be contributed over time.

  </p>

  <p>

    We spend a lot of time designing exactly how we want developers to
    interact with the client libraries, and are proud of how simple
    the current client libraries are to use and to read. A few
    specific principles guiding our work:

    <ol>

      <li> <b>Minimal Dependencies</b>: Where possible, we prefer client libraries that use 
      native dependencies of web frameworks
      (e.g. clients for Play Framework that require zero additional
      dependencies). Where impossible, we strive to use the
      most standard dependencies available.</li>

      <li> <b>Readability</b>: Each client library is first written by
      hand. We then automate the generation of that hand-written
      client. The goal is to make the generated client
      indistinguishable from a hand-written one. We will never reach
      100%, but we believe we are close.</li>

      <li> <b>Single File</b>: When you download a client from apidoc,
      you download a single fully contained, fully functional
      file. This makes it simple to either drop the file directly into
      your project or to build a library that features the standard tooling necessary to
      share it with the client.</li>

    </ol>
